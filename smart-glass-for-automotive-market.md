<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smart Glass for Automotive Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electrochromic</li><li>SPD</li><li>PDLC</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive smart glass market features three main types: Electrochromic, Suspended Particle Device (SPD), and Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystal (PDLC). Electrochromic glass changes tint in response to voltage, allowing for adjustable privacy and glare reduction. SPD technology uses suspended particles in a film, enabling quick transitions between clear and opaque states. PDLC glass becomes frosted or transparent when an electric current is applied, providing flexible privacy. These technologies enhance vehicle aesthetics, energy efficiency, and passenger comfort.</p></p>
