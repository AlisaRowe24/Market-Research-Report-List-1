<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diaphragm Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Weir diaphragm valves</li><li>Straightway diaphragm valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The diaphragm valves market is primarily segmented into two types: weir diaphragm valves and straightway diaphragm valves. Weir diaphragm valves feature an elevated seat that creates a weir, optimizing flow control and minimizing the risk of sediment buildup, making them ideal for applications involving slurries and viscous fluids. In contrast, straightway diaphragm valves have a linear flow path, facilitating smoother flow and lower pressure drops, which is beneficial for applications requiring high purity and minimal turbulence. Each type serves distinct industrial needs.</p></p>
