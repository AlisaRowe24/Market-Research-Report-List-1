<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Low Rolling Resistance Truck and Bus Radial Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bias Tires</li><li>Radial Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Low Rolling Resistance Truck and Bus Radial Tire market includes two main types: Bias Tires and Radial Tires. Bias Tires have layers of fabric plies that crisscross, providing flexibility and durability but typically higher rolling resistance. In contrast, Radial Tires feature plies arranged perpendicular to the tread, offering better fuel efficiency, improved handling, and lower rolling resistance. This makes Radial Tires more popular in the commercial sector, where fuel efficiency and performance are critical for operational cost reduction.</p></p>
