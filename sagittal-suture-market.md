<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sagittal Suture Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable sutures</li><li>Non-absorbable sutures</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The sagittal suture market encompasses two main types of sutures: absorbable and non-absorbable sutures. Absorbable sutures are designed to dissolve naturally over time, eliminating the need for removal and minimizing infection risks, making them suitable for internal surgical applications. In contrast, non-absorbable sutures remain in the body permanently or require surgical removal, often used for skin closures and areas needing long-term support. The choice between these sutures typically depends on the specific surgical requirements and patient needs.</p></p>
