<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Monofocal Intraocular Lens IOLs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Not Pre-loaded IOLs</li><li>Pre-loaded IOLs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Monofocal Intraocular Lens (IOL) market is divided into two main types: Not Pre-loaded IOLs and Pre-loaded IOLs. Not Pre-loaded IOLs require manual loading into an injector before implantation, offering flexibility for surgeons but requiring more skill. In contrast, Pre-loaded IOLs come pre-assembled in an injector, streamlining the surgical process and reducing the risk of contamination. This distinction affects operational efficiency, ease of use, and surgical outcomes, influencing preferences among ophthalmologists and patients.</p></p>
