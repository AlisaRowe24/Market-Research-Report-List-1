<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Displacement Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Contact Type</li><li>Contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aircraft displacement sensors market comprises two primary types: non-contact and contact sensors. Non-contact sensors, such as laser and capacitive sensors, measure displacement without physical contact, making them ideal for delicate applications. They offer high accuracy and rapid response times. Conversely, contact sensors, like linear variable differential transformers (LVDTs) and potentiometers, require physical contact to gauge displacement, providing reliable measurements in robust environments. Both types serve critical roles in monitoring aircraft components for maintenance, safety, and performance optimization.</p></p>
