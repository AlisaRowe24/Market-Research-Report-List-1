<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neuro Stimulators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Neuro-stimulators</li><li>Non-invasive Neuro-stimulators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The neurostimulator market is divided into two main types: invasive and non-invasive neurostimulators. Invasive neurostimulators involve surgical implantation within the body to deliver electrical impulses directly to targeted neural pathways, commonly used for conditions like epilepsy or chronic pain. Non-invasive neurostimulators, on the other hand, apply external stimulation methods, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, to modulate neural activity without the need for surgery. Both types aim to alleviate symptoms and improve patients' quality of life.</p></p>
