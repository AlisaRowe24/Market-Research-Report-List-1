<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Brake Pad Wear Indicators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electrical Indicators</li><li>Audible Indicators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Brake pad wear indicators are crucial for vehicle safety, alerting drivers to the need for maintenance. The market primarily features two types: electrical indicators and audible indicators. Electrical indicators use sensors to monitor brake pad thickness, triggering a warning light on the dashboard when wear is detected. Audible indicators, on the other hand, emit a sound when the brake pads wear down to a certain level, alerting the driver audibly. Both types enhance safety by ensuring timely pad replacement.</p></p>
