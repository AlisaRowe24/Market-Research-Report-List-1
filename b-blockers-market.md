<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The β-blockers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nonselective Agents</li><li>Selective Agents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The β-blockers market is divided into two main types: nonselective agents and selective agents. Nonselective β-blockers affect both β1 and β2 adrenergic receptors, offering broader therapeutic applications but potentially causing more side effects, particularly in respiratory conditions. Selective agents primarily target β1 receptors, making them preferable for conditions like heart failure and hypertension due to a reduced risk of respiratory impacts. This segmentation allows healthcare providers to tailor therapy based on individual patient needs and conditions.</p></p>
