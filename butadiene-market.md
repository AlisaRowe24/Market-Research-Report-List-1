<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Butadiene Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Extractive Distillation</li><li>Oxidative Dehydrogenation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The butadiene market primarily consists of two production technologies: extractive distillation and oxidative dehydrogenation. Extractive distillation involves the separation of butadiene from C4 hydrocarbons using solvents, optimizing yield and purity. In contrast, oxidative dehydrogenation converts butanes or butylenes into butadiene through oxidation reactions, offering a more direct synthesis pathway. Both methods cater to the growing demand for butadiene in the production of synthetic rubber, plastics, and other chemical intermediates, responding to industrial needs and sustainability goals.</p></p>
